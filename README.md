## About SimplePriorities

- _SimplePriorities gives you the ability to have x2 priority situations in your fivem server at all times, the way it works, is when you have a STATEWIDE patrol, players in the county would be able to have a priority situation, regardless of the situation in the city and vice versa, allowing 1 person from either city or county to have a high priority call, without conflicting with the other side._

## How to install SimplePriorities

- _To install, it's very simple. All you really need to do is drag and drop the resource into your `/resources` directory and then make sure it's started on server start up. You are more than welcome to edit the Config.lua to your likings and disable / enable the permission system built into the script._

## Ace Permission System Setup

- _The script comes with Ace permissions already built in, and you can change them by editing the ace groups via the config.lua. By defauly all permissions are hooked to the ace group "staff" ~ `add_ace fivem:123456 group.staff allow` ~ anyone hooked to the group staff would be allowed to do anything relating to the staff permissions via the script. for example, reset the priorities, put them on hold, etc._
